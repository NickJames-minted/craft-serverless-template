# Welcome to Serverless!
#
# This file is the main config file for your service.
# It's very minimal at this point and uses default values.
# You can always add more config options for more control.
# We've included some commented out config examples here.
# Just uncomment any of them to get that config option.
#
# For full config options, check the docs:
#    docs.serverless.com

# Happy Coding!

# you can add CloudFormation resource templates here
# From the docs: https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/resources/
#To have consistent naming in the CloudFormation Templates that get deployed we use a standard pattern:
  # {Function Name}{Cloud Formation Resource Type}{Resource Name}{SequentialID or Random String}
    # Function Name - This is optional for Resources that should be recreated when the function name gets changed. Those resources are also called function bound
    # Cloud Formation Resource Type - E.g., S3Bucket
    # Resource Name - An identifier for the specific resource, e.g. for an S3 Bucket the configured bucket name.
    # SequentialID or Random String - For a few resources we need to add an optional sequential id or random string to identify them
